The `causalQual` package provides a suite of tools for estimating causal effects when the outcome targeted by the treatment is qualitative - i.e., multinomial or ordered.

Standard causal inference methods such as instrumental variables (IV), regression discontinuity (RD), and difference-in-differences (DiD) are typically designed for numeric outcomes. Their direct application to qualitative outcomes leads to ill-defined estimands, rendering results arbitrary and uninterpretable.

This package implements the framework introduced in Di Francesco and Mellace (2025), shifting the focus to well-defined and interpretable estimands that quantify how treatment affects the probability distribution over outcome categories. The methods remain compatible with conventional research designs, ensuring ease of implementation for applied researchers.

## Why use `causalQual`?

| Feature | Benefit |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Avoids misleading conclusions** | Conventional estimands are often undefined or depend on arbitrary outcome coding. `causalQual` targets interpretable and meaningful estimands. |
| **Provides well-defined estimands** | Instead of relying on average effects, `causalQual` models how treatment shifts probabilities over outcome categories. |
| **Wide applicability** | Supports selection-on-observables, IV, RD, and DiD. |
| **Extensible and open-source** | Actively developed with planned support for staggered adoption, fuzzy regression discontinuity, and more. |
